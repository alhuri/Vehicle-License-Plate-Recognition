# Vehicle-License-Plate-Recognition
License plate recognition systems have been an
interest in recent years for their role in intelligent traffic
management. This work illustrates a design and development
of an efficient Automatic number plate recognition system
(ANPR), using image processing and deep learning techniques.
The paper focuses on the deep learning SSD MobileNet model,
which will be used to detect the number plate of the vehicle.
We utilized two different sequential convolutional neural
networks that are smart enough to recognize plates characters.
Moreover, it is shown that with variations of pretrained
architectures, one can obtain the desired trade-off between
complexity and accuracy, and SSD MobileNet v2 and a simple
CNN model can obtain the desired results with satisfying cost
and accuracy.

## Dataset
In this work, we utilized two publicly available datasets
from Kaggle. For detection, the dataset includes 433 images
with bounding box annotations of the automobile license
plates contained inside the image. The second dataset has
binary images of characters used for plate segmented
character recognition.
